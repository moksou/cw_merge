# cw_merge

It's a simple(?) C program merging at least two PWAD's into one with all necessary resources (music, sounds, textures etc). 

# Usage
```sh
$ ./cw_merge first.wad second.wad result.wad
```

# Bugs/limitations
- Doens't merging anything yet. Just showing all maps and all textures/flats in.
- Not tested in non-Linux OS.
